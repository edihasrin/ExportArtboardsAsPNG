ExportArtboardsAsPNG.jsx
========================

Export an Adobe Illustrator file’s artboards to separate PNG files.

## Installation Instructions

For quick access, put scripts in `/Applications/Adobe Illustrator\ CS6/Presets/en_US/Scripts/` (may be different on a PC) and restart Illustrator so it recognizes them. Now the scripts will show up under `File→Scripts`. If you don’t put the scripts in this directory, you can also just navigate to `File→Scripts→Other Script…` to choose the script (but you’ll have to do that each time you want to use it).
