ExportArtboardsAsPNG.jsx
========================

Export an Adobe Illustrator file’s artboards to separate PNG files.

Based on a script by Dan Smith ([@dansketchpad](http://twitter.com/dansketchpad)) via [John Hicks](http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/illustrator-export-artboards-as-png32) that exports all Illustrator artboards to .png files.

Over the years, I’ve updated the script to my liking, and I also made a version that takes non-retina designs in Illustrator and automagically turns them into retina designs. (Remember? Illustrator is vector-based, not pixel based, so you can export to any size you want without losing quality.) Figured it was about time to track my tweaks and make it available on teh githubs.

## Installation Instructions

For quick access, put scripts in `/Applications/Adobe Illustrator\ CS6/Presets/en_US/Scripts/` (may be different on a PC) and restart Illustrator so it recognizes them. Now the scripts will show up under `File→Scripts`. If you don’t put the scripts in this directory, you can also just navigate to `File→Scripts→Other Script…` to choose the script (but you’ll have to do that each time you want to use it).
